            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Down The River was founded in 2012 by a group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts who shared a deep love
                for rivers and adventure. What began as a small, local rafting outfit with just two rafts and weekend
                tours has grown into a respected name in the outdoor adventure industry. Inspired by a vision to make
                whitewater rafting accessible, safe, and exhilarating for everyone, the founders focused on quality
                service, environmental stewardship, and strong community connections. Over the years, Rapids Quest
                Adventures has expanded its routes, trained expert guides, and welcomed thousands of adventurers from
                around the world—each one leaving with a story written on the water. Today, the company continues to
                thrive as a symbol of adventure, safety, and connection with nature.</p>
